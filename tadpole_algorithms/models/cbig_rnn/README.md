## Release Note
The RNN model implementation is for Tadpole-Share project, which is 
aiming to gather top algorithms in Tadpole challenge 2017. 

You could refer to Reference for more details about RNN model. 

You could also visit https://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG/tree/master/stable_projects/predict_phenotypes/Nguyen2020_RNNAD for 
original RNN implementation. 

Compared with original MinimalRNN implementation in CBIG repo, there are 
three differences in CBIG_RNN@Tadpole-Share:
1. We upgrade MinimalRNN from Python 2.7 to Python 3.6;
2. We do not conduct K-fold cross-validation.
3. The default features selection is different. 

**Happy research!**
